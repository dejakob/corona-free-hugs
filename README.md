## How it works

### Static pages

All pages are completely static and hosted on Gcloud storage.

They pages are getting generated on build time with React and some node scripts.

Check out [the pages folder](./site/src/pages) to see the source code of all pages.

### CSS first, JS maybe later

All pages work with CSS and have some tiny amount of JS for extra interactivity.

Like, how much client JS do you need to create a form?

### Creating a hug

A serverless cloud function takes care of hug creation.

The function can be found in [worker-triggers](./worker-triggers/create-hug).

This will use this repo as a package to run the [createHug script](./workers/create-hug.js).

The script will render another static page and upload it to Gcloud storage.

This way, there'll be no server delay when opening a page; but a little bit when creating a hug
